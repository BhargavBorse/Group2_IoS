// Description: The goal of our project, the "Cruise App," is to create a thorough and user-friendly mobile application that makes it easier for vacationers to research, pick, and book cruises. This app will enable customers to easily plan their cruise holidays by offering comprehensive cruise information, configurable booking options, secure payment processing, and transparent booking summary. It places a strong emphasis on ease, accessibility, and customer happiness.
